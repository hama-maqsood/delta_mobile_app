The distribution rules are designed so that 40% of the total income will be used as developer technical service commissions, and the remaining 60% will be used as community absenteeism rewards. The absenteeism reward part adopts a multi-level distribution model similar to DTC, and these absenteeism rewards are divided into 3 shares according to the ratio of 6:3:1, and 60% of the absenteeism reward for one USCT mining each time is allocated to the absenteeism who is currently watching the advertisement , 30% is allocated to the superior recommender, and 10% is allocated to the second-level recommender. In the same way, you can also get the same recommender rewards from the friends you recommend through USCT mining.
